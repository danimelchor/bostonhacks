# Boston Hacks FoodPrint
Hi!

This is the Boston Hacks 2020 project I made. I had two teammates during the first two days but they both ended up dropping out unexpectedly only a few hours before the presentations. Because of this, I was unable to finish the project on time, but, since I started it, I decided I will finish it soon after my website danielmelchor.com is done.

# Purpose
The idea of this app was from one of my teammates. The initial goal was to create a website that could quickly output how much each type of food polluted the country, but after a lot of stress and my teammates dropping out I decided to rethink everything. I believe this can end up being a project used to show the massive spread of fast-food restaurants compared to others that are more sustainable and healthy.
